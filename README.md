Capstone project for the Software Engineering Immersive

## Magic the Gathering Commander deck builder
Users may create an account to build and track a collection of Commander decks of Magic the Gathering (MTG) cards. Commander is a game format of MTG where decks consist of 99 cards plus one Commander on the side. Card data will come from an external API and be stored in a database connected to the app. The app will display an analysis of a particular deck based on its composition and allow the user to draw sample hands.
